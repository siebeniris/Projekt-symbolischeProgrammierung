Planning for the presidential transition of [[Kurt Cobain|Donald]] [[Donald Trump|Trump,]] led by the Vice President-elect, Governor [[Green Day|Mike]] [[Mike Pence|Pence]] of Indiana, began before [[Kurt Cobain|Donald]] [[Judd Trump|Trump]] won the [[Race (United States Census)|United]] [[Race (United States Census)|States]] presidential election on November 8, 2016, and became the President-elect. The transition was formerly led by [[New Testament|Chris]] [[Chris Christie|Christie]] until he and a number of his supporters were replaced or demoted on November 11.

He was formally elected by the [[Electoral Calculus|Electoral]] [[New York University|College]] on December 19, 2016, with 304 electoral votes, 34 more than needed. The results will be certified by a joint session of [[Art Institute of Chicago|Congress]] in January 2017, and the transition will end when he is inaugurated at noon EST on January 20, 2017.

In accordance with the Pre-Election Presidential Transition Act of 2010, candidate transition teams are provided office space by the [[Lok Sabha|General]] [[United States Postal Service|Services]] [[New York University|Administration]] (GSA). [[Digital television transition in the United States|Transition]] teams are also eligible for government funding for staff; spending on [[Mithun Chakraborty|Mitt]] [[George W. Romney|Romney's]] transition team in 2012 was $8.9 million, all funds appropriated by the [[Race (United States Census)|U.S.]] government.

Under existing federal law and custom, the Republican Party's nominee became eligible to receive classified national security briefings once hisher nomination was formalized at the party's national convention.

Key responsibilities of a presidential transition include the identification and vetting of candidates for approximately 4,000 non-civil service positions in the [[Race (United States Census)|U.S.]] government whose service is at the pleasure of the president; arranging the occupancy of executive residences including the [[Race (United States Census)|White]] [[Royal Opera House|House,]] [[Tony Blair|One]] [[La Silla Observatory|Observatory]] Circle, and Camp David; liaising with the [[Race (United States Census)|United]] [[Race (United States Census)|States]] [[Gulf War|Strategic]] [[United States Coast Guard|Command]] for receipt of the Gold Codes; and briefing senior civil service personnel about a new administration's policy priorities.

A law enacted by the [[Race (United States Census)|United]] [[Race (United States Census)|States]] [[Art Institute of Chicago|Congress]] in 2016 requires the incumbent President to establish "transition councils" by June of an election year to facilitate the eventual handover of power.

The [[National Center for Education Statistics|National]] [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Academy]] [[Race (United States Census)|of]] [[New York University|Public]] [[New York University|Administration]] (NAPA), meanwhile, launched a new program called "Transition 2016" in 2016. Led by [[The Times of India|Ed]] [[Alexander Procofieff de Seversky|DeSeve]] and [[David Ferrer|David]] [[Race (United States Census)|S.]] [[Cambridge University Press|C.]] [[Steven Chu|Chu,]] the program was described by [[Riverside International Raceway|NAPA]] as one which provides management and procedural advice to the leading candidates in establishing transition teams.

In April 2016, representatives from the [[Judd Trump|Trump]] campaign, as well as the campaigns of four other then-running Republican candidates, met in [[Anime News Network|New]] [[New York University|York]] with representatives of the [[Rogers Communications|Partnership]] [[Twitter|for]] [[New York University|Public]] [[Toronto Star|Service]] to receive a two-day briefing and overview of the transition process. According to [[Judd Trump|Trump]] campaign manager [[Raekwon|Corey]] Lewandowski, the campaign shortly thereafter began implementing the recommendations provided at the meeting. In early May 2016, after [[Judd Trump|Trump]] became the presumptive nominee, campaign officials announced they would name the members of a presidential transition team within the "upcoming weeks". On May 6, The [[Anime News Network|New]] [[New York University|York]] [[The Times of India|Times]] reported that [[Judd Trump|Trump]] had asked [[Kings of Leon|Jared]] [[Tony Kushner|Kushner]] to begin work on putting a transition team together. [[Raekwon|Corey]] [[Robert Lewandowski|Lewandowski]] and [[Paul Haarhuis|Paul]] [[Paul Manafort|Manafort]] worked with [[Tony Kushner|Kushner]] in the selection of a transition chief. Three days later, [[Judd Trump|Trump]] announced that [[Anime News Network|New]] [[Professional wrestling match types|Jersey]] Governor (and former rival Presidential candidate) [[New Testament|Chris]] [[Chris Christie|Christie]] had agreed to head the effort.

On Friday, June 3, 2016, the [[Texas Education Agency|Agency]] [[Digital television transition in the United States|Transition]] [[Vienna State Opera|Directors]] [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation|Council]] first assembled at the [[Race (United States Census)|White]] [[Lok Sabha|House]] to review transition plans of each of the major executive departments; neither the [[Judd Trump|Trump]] nor [[Animaniacs|Clinton]] campaigns sent representatives to this initial meeting. At about the same time, the [[Race (United States Census)|White]] [[Lok Sabha|House]] began transferring its preceding eight years of accumulated electronic files to the [[National Center for Education Statistics|National]] [[British Newspaper Archive|Archives]] and Records Administration's Electronic Record Archive for preservation.

The transition planning came under heavy criticism for lagging behind other recent transition planning efforts when it was shown to have hired only a "handful" of staff by late July. In late July [[New Testament|Chris]] [[Chris Christie|Christie]] named [[Hot Country Songs|Bill]] Palatucci, a corporate attorney from [[Anime News Network|New]] [[Professional wrestling match types|Jersey]] and the state's Republican National Committeeman, as general counsel; [[Giovanni Palatucci|Palatucci]] reportedly began meeting with senior members of Mitt Romney's 2012 transition team shortly thereafter. Meanwhile, on July 29, [[Race (United States Census)|White]] [[Lok Sabha|House]] chief of staff [[Stade de France|Denis]] [[Sean McDonough|McDonough]] led a conference call with [[New Testament|Chris]] [[Chris Christie|Christie]] to discuss transition procedures. During the call, [[Sean McDonough|McDonough]] informed [[Chris Christie|Christie]] that [[Rajesh Khanna|Anita]] [[Simon Nicol|Breckenridge]] and [[{{|Andrew]] [[Mike Mayock|Mayock]] will be the administration's primary "points of contact" with the [[Judd Trump|Trump]] campaign moving forward. The pair also discussed the planned availability of office space at 1717 [[The Philadelphia Inquirer|Pennsylvania]] [[Santiago, Chile|Avenue]] for the [[Judd Trump|Trump]] transition team, which the [[Lok Sabha|General]] [[United States Postal Service|Services]] [[New York University|Administration]] was to make available beginning August 2, 2016.

During the first week of August, the [[Judd Trump|Trump]] transition office was officially opened. The same month [[HarperCollins|William]] Hagerty, a former member of Mitt Romney's transition team, was named director of appointments while [[New Testament|John]] [[Randall Ray Rader|Rader,]] a senior aide to [[Race (United States Census)|United]] [[Race (United States Census)|States]] [[New York State Senate|Senate]] [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry|Foreign]] [[About.com|Relations]] [[Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names|Committee]] chair [[Adam Sandler|Bob]] [[Bob Corker|Corker,]] was retained in the position of deputy director of appointments.

In an example of "how removed the transition process is from the tumult and rancor of the campaign", representatives of the [[Judd Trump|Trump]] and [[Animaniacs|Clinton]] transition teams began holding a series of meetings with each other, and with [[Race (United States Census)|White]] [[Lok Sabha|House]] officials, to plan details of the transition process.

By October it was reported the transition team had grown to more than 100 staff, many of whom were policy experts brought aboard to compensate for a dearth of policy staff employed by the [[Judd Trump|Trump]] campaign. For example, in October 2016, [[Roberta Vinci|Robert]] [[Busta Rhymes|Smith]] Walker, former chairman of the House Science Committee, was appointed space policy adviser.
In the early hours of November 9, 2016, media outlets reported [[Judd Trump|Trump]] would secure enough votes in the [[Electoral Calculus|Electoral]] [[New York University|College]] to be chosen 45th president of the [[Race (United States Census)|United]] [[United States|States.]] [[Hillary Lindsey|Hillary]] [[Animaniacs|Clinton]] conceded the election later that day.

Prior to Trump's return to his private residence at [[Judd Trump|Trump]] Tower, the [[Race (United States Census)|United]] [[Race (United States Census)|States]] [[Lok Sabha|Secret]] [[Toronto Star|Service]] initiated "unbelievable security measures", including closing East 56th Street to all traffic, reinforcing a cordon of sand-laden dump trucks that had been placed around the building the night before to defend the site from being rammed with a car bomb, and deploying [[Anime News Network|New]] [[New York University|York]] [[Drum kit|City]] [[Gestapo|Police]] [[Brown University|Department]] tactical teams around the skyscraper. The FAA, meanwhile, ordered a flight restriction over midtown Manhattan.
Following the election, [[Judd Trump|Trump]] began transferring control of the [[Judd Trump|Trump]] [[American Psychological Association|Organization]] to the company's other executives, including his three oldest children, Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric. According to a November 11 statement from the [[Judd Trump|Trump]] Organization, it was “in the process of vetting various structures with the goal of the immediate transfer of management of the [[Judd Trump|Trump]] [[American Psychological Association|Organization]] and its portfolio of businesses”. The president-elect's assets would also be moved into a blind trust, though some criticized the specific arrangement, with one observer characterizing it as a "one-eye-closed-and-one-eye-open trust".

Shortly after noon on November 9, outgoing president [[Charles I of England|Barack]] [[Charles I of England|Obama]] made a statement from the [[Rosaceae|Rose]] [[Royal Opera House|Garden]] of the [[Race (United States Census)|White]] [[Lok Sabha|House]] in which he announced that he had spoken, the previous evening, with [[Judd Trump|Trump]] and formally invited him to the [[Race (United States Census)|White]] [[Lok Sabha|House]] the next day, November 10, for discussions to ensure "that there is a successful transition between our presidencies". President [[Charles I of England|Obama]] said he had instructed his staff to "follow the example" of the [[George Gershwin|George]] [[HarperCollins|W.]] [[Bushehr Province|Bush]] administration in 2008, whom he said could "not have been more professional or more gracious in making sure we had a smooth transition".
The same day, [[Race (United States Census)|United]] [[Race (United States Census)|States]] Secretary of [[Philadelphia Flyers|Defense]] [[University of Cincinnati|Ash]] [[Lil Wayne|Carter]] issued a memo to the [[Race (United States Census)|United]] [[Race (United States Census)|States]] armed forces informing them of the pending transfer of [[National Center for Education Statistics|National]] [[United States Coast Guard|Command]] [[Texas Department of Transportation|Authority]] to a new admin
istration. Also on November 9, the [[Race (United States Census)|U.S.]] [[Springer Science+Business Media|Intelligence]] [[Lok Sabha|Community]] offered the full President's Daily Brief to [[Judd Trump|Trump]] and [[Green Day|Mike]] [[Mike Pence|Pence,]] with [[Judd Trump|Trump]] receiving his first brief on November 15 in his office at [[Judd Trump|Trump]] [[Tower Records|Tower.]]

By the afternoon of November 9, a transition website – greatagain.gov – had been launched. The website provided information on transition procedures and information for the media. The website was later criticized for reposting content originally created by the Partnership for Public Service, however, Partnership CEO [[Jeff Gordon|Max]] [[Rigoberta MenchÃº|Stier]] declined to criticize the use and noted that the organization had been working with the major campaigns on transition planning, explaining that he hoped the group's materials would be "a resource that is used for the betterment of transitions".

[[Judd Trump|Trump]] and [[Charles I of England|Obama]] met for the first time on November 10.

At 11:00 a.m. on November 10, the President and President-elect held a private, 90-minute meeting at the White House, which was followed by a joint media availability in the [[Subiaco Oval|Oval]] [[HBO|Office]] with a press pool composed of journalists from Reuters, Voice of America, Bloomberg, the Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, ABC News, and [[Caitlin McClatchey|McClatchey]] syndicate. During the availability, [[Judd Trump|Trump]] thanked [[Charles I of England|Obama]] for their meeting and said he looked forward to tapping him for future counsel. According to Trump, [[Charles I of England|Obama]] convinced him, during their discussion, to retain certain aspects of his signature policy Obamacare, including the ban on insurance companies denying new coverage to those with preexisting conditions and the right of parents to keep their adult children on their health insurance policies to the age of 25.

On November 11, [[Judd Trump|Trump]] telephoned transition head [[New Testament|Chris]] [[Chris Christie|Christie]] and told him his involvement with the Bridgegate scandal was a political liability and his performance heading the transition unsatisfactory (Trump, later, also expressed private frustration at Christie's retention of lobbyists in key transition posts). At the end of the call, [[Judd Trump|Trump]] fired [[Chris Christie|Christie]] from his position as transition chair. Over the next twenty-four hours, and with little warning, [[Chris Christie|Christie]] loyalists were quickly removed from the transition team in what was characterized by [[Days of Our Lives|NBC]] [[Anime News Network|News]] as a "Stalinesque purge". Transition executive [[Richard Childress Racing|Richard]] Bagger, for instance, found himself suddenly locked-out of the transition team's offices. Bill Palatucci, Mike Rogers, and others, were also among those removed.

Immediately after the reshuffle, [[Green Day|Mike]] [[Mike Pence|Pence]] was elevated to transition chair by Trump. Under Christie, many of the members of the transition team were registered lobbyists who had worked on issues overseen by the agencies they were charged with staffing or affected by policies they were preparing. However, by November 16 Pence had introduced new restrictions that Politico described as "in some ways far more rigid than President [[Charles I of England|Barack]] Obama’s groundbreaking lobbyist ban". Under the new rules, while incoming administration officials who are currently registered lobbyists would be allowed, they would have to sign documents forfeiting their ability to re-register as lobbyists for five years after departing government. [a] In addition, [[Green Day|Mike]] [[Mike Pence|Pence]] ordered that all lobbyists be removed from the transition team with [[Methuen Publishing|Politico]] reporting two days later that staff members who were registered lobbyists had begun to resign.

On November 15, [[Judd Trump|Trump]] requested security clearance for son-in-law [[Kings of Leon|Jared]] [[Tony Kushner|Kushner]] (a member of the transition team), which would allow him to attend the full President's Daily Brief – a request that experts have called "unprecedented".

As of November 15, all briefings of the transition team by government were on hold pending the need for incoming chair [[Green Day|Mike]] [[Mike Pence|Pence]] to sign an agreement with the [[Charles I of England|Obama]] administration.

On November 16, [[Judd Trump|Trump]] met with [[Professional wrestling throws|Alabama]] senator [[Jeff Gordon|Jeff]] [[Roger Sessions|Sessions,]] who had been discussed as a possible contender for several cabinet positions. [[Judd Trump|Trump]] also met with [[Anime News Network|New]] [[New York University|York]] [[Drum kit|City]] Mayor [[Hot Country Songs|Bill]] [[Race (United States Census)|de]] Blasio.

On November 17, [[Judd Trump|Trump]] met with former Secretary of [[Race (United States Census)|State]] [[Christ Church, Oxford|Henry]] [[American Academy in Berlin|Kissinger]] in order to discuss matters relating to foreign affairs. Later that day [[Judd Trump|Trump]] met with Japanese prime minister [[Shinzo Koroki|Shinzo]] [[University of Aberdeen|Abe]] in an informal visit at [[Judd Trump|Trump]] Tower. After the meeting, which was attended by [[Penguin Books|Michael]] [[Errol Flynn|Flynn]] and [[Ivanka Trump|Ivanka]] [[Donald Trump|Trump,]] [[University of Aberdeen|Abe]] said he had "great confidence" in [[Judd Trump|Trump]] and described their discussion as "very candid". Past and current [[Race (United States Census)|State]] [[Brown University|Department]] officials, however, were disturbed by Ivanka's presence. [[Moira Kelly|Moira]] Whelan, a former [[New Testament|John]] [[Kerry Washington|Kerry]] 2004 presidential campaign staffer who left the department in July after serving as a deputy assistant secretary for digital strategy in the [[Race (United States Census)|U.S.]] Department of State, averred that "anyone present for such a conversation between two heads of state should, at a minimum, have security clearance, and should also be an expert in Japanese affairs ... meeting of two heads of state [sic][b] is never an informal occurrence. Even a casual mention or a nod of agreement or an assertion left unchallenged can be interpreted in different ways".

On December 6, [[Penguin Books|Michael]] [[United States Coast Guard|G.]] [[Gillian Flynn|Flynn,]] the son of [[Penguin Books|Michael]] [[Asteraceae|T.]] [[Gillian Flynn|Flynn,]] was forced out of the transition team. Spokesman [[Alternative Press|Jason]] [[Thomas Edison|Miller]] did not identify the reason for Flynn's dismissal; however, the [[Anime News Network|New]] [[New York University|York]] [[The Times of India|Times]] reported that other officials had confirmed it was related to a tweet he made regarding the Pizzagate conspiracy theory.

On December 14, [[Judd Trump|Trump]] met with CEOs and representatives from [[Palo Alto, California|Silicon]] [[Kathmandu|Valley]] tech companies in his [[Judd Trump|Trump]] [[Tower Records|Tower.]]

An organizational chart of the transition team has been made public by the [[Anime News Network|New]] [[New York University|York]] Times. It divides the work into two areas: "agency action" led by [[Ronnie O'Sullivan|Ron]] [[Nicolas Mahut|Nicol]] and "policy implementation" led by Ado Machida.

Large numbers of foreign policy advisers are seeking to leave the [[Mary Whitehouse|Whitehouse]] team unwilling to work with Trump's team.

The following have been named as cabinet appointees by the President-elect; all positions, except Chief of Staff and Vice President require the advice and consent of the [[Race (United States Census)|United]] [[Race (United States Census)|States]] [[New York State Senate|Senate]] prior to taking office.

On November 30, Politico, which viewed Trump's chosen administration nominees as being more conservative as opposed to previous presidential administrations, described [[Judd Trump|Trump]] as "well on his way to building a conservative dream team that has Republicans cheering and liberals in despair." On the other hand, The [[Ultratop|Wall]] [[HarperCollins|Street]] [[Cambridge University Press|Journal]] stated that "it’s nearly impossible to identify a clear ideological bent in the incoming president’s" cabinet nominations.

The [[New York University|Washington]] [[United States Postal Service|Post]] noted that Trump's cabinet would be "the wealthiest administration in modern American history." The [[United States Postal Service|Post]] also noted that while some of Trump's appointments consisted of "his staunchest and most controversial allies" such as Bannon, [[Errol Flynn|Flynn]] and Sessions, other appointments appealed to the Republican establishment and had "the imprint of [[Green Day|Mike]] Pence".
